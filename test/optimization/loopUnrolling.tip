/*
 * Benchmark for loop full unrolling (LU) optimization.
 *
 * Compile with and without the -lu optimization then run:
 *   time ./loopUnrolling
 * to observe the execution time of the benchmark.
 * You should be able to see a 4-6x speedup with loop unrolling.
 * Now add the -lscfg to the -lu optimization then run:
 *   time ./loopUnrolling
 * to observe the execution time of the benchmark.
 * You should be able to see another 4-6x speedup with loop unrolling.
